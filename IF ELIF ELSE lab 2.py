Compare Variables or Objects For Equivalence:

This Lab is about Asking Questions and comparing Variables 
or Objects.  Is the Answer "TRUE"?
      
The == is a comparison to see if 2 variables or objects 
are equivalent or equal, but there are many other ways 
to compare objects
      
x == y      # x is equal to y
x != y      # x is not equal to y
x > y       # x is greater than y
x < y       # x is less than y
x >= y      # x is greater than or equal to y
x <= y      # x is less than or equal to y
x is y      # x is the same as y
x is not y  # x is not the same as y

----------------------------------------------------
Try changing the values of x and y and see what happends
